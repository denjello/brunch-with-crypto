We're using a JSON version of the recipeML format. 
http://www.formatdata.com/recipeml/

We call it **recipeson**.

Future work:

- An interface
 - That automatically parses the contents of the recipes and creates the lists
 - A way to move the items from shopping list to shopping list that automatically updates the git repository and pushes to other listening clients via socket.io
- An openstreetmaps plugin to put the closest shops on a shopping tour
